# Covid19_new_deaths_tracker
This is a basic python script which keeps on updating itself every time you run it, it shows a graph where x = new deaths and y = country. plotted using plotly.
Trying my hands on real time data.
The graph isnt plotting on github , you can see the whole graph here : https://nbviewer.org/github/Ritik933/Covid19_new_deaths_tracker/blob/main/covid_new_deaths_tracker.ipynb
